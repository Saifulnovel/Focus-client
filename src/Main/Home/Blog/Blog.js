              What are the different ways to manage a state in a React
              application?

                When we talk about state in our applications, it’s important to
                be clear about what types of state actually matter. There are
                four main types of state you need to properly manage in your
                React apps: Local state: Local (UI) state – Local state is data
                we manage in one or another component Global state: Global (UI)
                state – Global state is data we manage across multiple
                components. Server state: Server state – Data that comes from an
                external server that must be integrated with our UI state. URL
                state: URL state – Data that exists on our URLs, including the
                pathname and query parameters.

              How does prototypical inheritance work?

                How does prototypical inheritance work in react? Prototypical
                inheritance allows us to reuse the properties or methods from
                one JavaScript object to another through a reference pointer
                function. All JavaScript objects inherit properties and methods
                from a prototype: Date objects inherit from Date. When it comes
                to inheritance, JavaScript only has one construct: objects. Each
                object has a private property which holds a link to another
                object called its prototype. That prototype object has a
                prototype of its own, and so on until an object is reached with
                null as its prototype.

              What is a unit test? Why should we write unit tests?

              <p>
                A unit test is a way of testing a unit - the smallest piece of
                code that can be logically isolated in a system. In most
                programming languages, that is a function, a subroutine, a
                method or property. The isolated part of the definition is
                important. To justify any effort in business, there must be a
                positive impact on the bottom line. Here are a few benefits to
                writing unit tests:
                <strong>This is why should write unite test</strong>
                Unit tests save time and money. Usually, we tend to test the
                happy path more than the unhappy path. If you release such an
                app without thorough testing, you would have to keep fixing
                issues raised by your potential users. The time to fix these
                issues could’ve been used to build new features or optimize the
                existing system. Bear in mind that fixing bugs without running
                tests could also introduce new bugs into the system.
                Well-written unit tests act as documentation for your code. Any
                developer can quickly look at your tests and know the purpose of
                your functions. It simplifies the debugging process. Unit
                testing is an integral part of extreme programming. Extreme
                programming is basically a
                “test-everything-that-can-possibly-break” programming strategy.
                Unit tests make code reuse easier. If you want to reuse existing
                code in a new project, you can simply migrate both the code and
                tests to your new project, then run your tests to make sure you
                have the desired results. Unit testing improves code coverage. A
                debatable topic is to have 100% code coverage across your
                application. In the testing pyramid, unit tests are faster than
                integration and end-to-end. They are more assertive and return
                quick feedback

              React vs.Angular vs.Vue?

                The choice between React vs Vue is often debated and it’s not an
                easy one. Vue has a vibrant and ever-growing community and has
                taken over popularity vs. React in many respects. React
                developers are still churning out lots of new components and
                extras, so there’s no sign that React is on the decline either.
                Vue is generally more suited to smaller, less complex apps and
                is easier to learn from scratch compared to React. Vue can be
                easier to integrate into new or existing projects and many feel
                its use of HTML templates along with JSX is an advantage.
                Overall, Vue might be the best choice if you’re a newer
                developer and not as familiar with advanced JavaScript concepts,
                while React is quite well suited for experienced programmers and
                developers who have worked with object-oriented JavaScript,
                functional JavaScript, and similar concepts.
